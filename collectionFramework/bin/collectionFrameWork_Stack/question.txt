Sure, here are 10 programming tasks involving the Stack class in the Java Collection Framework:

1. **Basic Stack Operations:** Done
   Write a Java program to demonstrate the basic stack operations (push, pop, peek, and search) using the Stack class.

2. **Check Balanced Parentheses:** Done
   Implement a Java function that uses a Stack to check if a given string containing parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced.

3. **Reverse a String Using Stack:** Done
   Write a Java program to reverse a string using a Stack.

4. **Implement Queue Using Stacks:**
   Design a Java class that implements a queue using two stacks.

5. **Evaluate Postfix Expression:**
   Create a Java function to evaluate a postfix expression using a Stack.

6. **Sort a Stack:**
   Write a Java program to sort the elements of a stack in ascending order using a temporary stack.

7. **Find the Minimum Element in a Stack:** Done
   Design a Java class to support push, pop, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time using a single stack.

8. **Next Greater Element:**
   Write a Java function that finds the next greater element for each element of an array using a Stack.

9. **Infix to Postfix Conversion:**
   Implement a Java function to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression using a Stack.

10. **Stack with Middle Element Access:**
    Create a Java class that supports push, pop, and finding the middle element of a stack in constant time, and allows deleting the middle element in constant time.
